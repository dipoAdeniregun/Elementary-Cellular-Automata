# Elementary-Cellular-Automata
 Parallel implementation of an ECA with OpenCV visualization.

 Implements an elementary Celullar Automata in part 1 and uses OpenCV to visualize the result.
 The size of the ECA and the Rule for the ECA are passed in as command line arguments.
 Part 2 Paralellizes the ECA algorithm in Part 1 using the MPI library
